```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "/Users/Addie/Intro to Data Science/FinalProject/data")
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r dataframe setup}
communities <- read_csv("communities.data")
communities <- transform(communities,
                         state = as.integer(state),
                         county = as.integer(county),
                         community = as.integer(community),
                         communityname = as.factor(communityname))
communities <- rename(communities, racePctBlack = racepctblack)
communities
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
